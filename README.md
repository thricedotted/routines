# routines

Routines is a tiny single-page, offline-first, progressive web app for tracking routines. (Whew! Buzzwords!)

Here's a preview URL, liable to break at any time: [https://routines-pwa-preview.netlify.com](https://routines-pwa-preview.netlify.com).

Routines is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router), and [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com). For now, all data is locally stored -- there's no auth or server sync here, because there's no server component (yet???)!

This is a side project for me to have fun with JS and CSS and Svelte and service workers. Poke at your own risk.
